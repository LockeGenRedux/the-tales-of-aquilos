## Features to Come
Several new Archetypes, based off of the iconics within Aquilos, as well as several themed after the powerful Babylonian Specialists.
- The incarnate-spell based Ikonist, who bonds with powerful creatures across the realm and calls them forth during battle.
- The stalwart and agile Royal Dragoon, who wield polearms and reach weapons to great effect, while combining their martial prowess with powerful hops and leaps.
- The Voidwalker, survivors who've brushed with nothingness and now use the power of the Void to do their bidding.
- The versatile and talented Hecatonchieres, who's turned their prothestic limb into a mount for unique gadgets to assist them in any situation.

And plenty more to come! Much of this is a work in progress, so pardon the dust.
